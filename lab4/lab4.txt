1. Grab a copy of the Diffutils repository with the following command:
	$ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git

2. Grab a copy of the log of changes with the following command:
	$ git log > git-log.txt

3. Grab a copy of the list of tags used:
	$ git tags > git-tags.txt

4. Using ctrl-F to find the commit with the text reveals the following:
	
	commit 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f
	Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
	Date:   Wed Jan 25 23:46:16 2012 -0800

Then generate a patch for the commit using the following command:
	$ git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f >quote-patch.txt

5. Checkout version 3.0 of Diffutils with the following command:
	$ git checkout v3.0

6. Now patch v3.0 using the following command:
	$ patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt
		- the p1 command strips one / from the patch dir given
		- several of the files did not exist and therefore were skipped in
		patching it with RETURN

7. Now to see which files were modified use the following command:
	$ git status

8. Whats the point of C-x v = and C-x vu, and which files do i open?
