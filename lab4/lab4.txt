1. Grab a copy of the Diffutils repository with the following command:
	$ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git

2. Grab a copy of the log of changes with the following command:
	$ git log > git-log.txt

3. Grab a copy of the list of tags used:
	$ git tag > git-tags.txt

4. Using ctrl-F to find the commit with the text reveals the following:
	
	commit 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f
	Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
	Date:   Wed Jan 25 23:46:16 2012 -0800

Then generate a patch for the commit using the following command:
	$ git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f >quote-patch.txt

5. Checkout version 3.0 of Diffutils with the following command:
	$ git checkout v3.0

6. Now patch v3.0 using the following command:
	$ patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt
		- the p1 command strips one / from the patch dir given
		- several of the files did not exist and therefore were skipped in
		patching it with RETURN

7. Now to see which files were modified use the following command:
	$ git status

9. Now revert all changes to files other than .c files using the following:
	$ git checkout -- <file> 
		- do this for NEWS, README, TODO, doc/diagmeet.note, ms/config.bat
		ms/config.site, po/en.po, tests/help-version

Similarily within .c files if there were any changes applied to comments
revert the changes by hand using the emacs functions
	$ emacs <file>
		to file: cmp.c diff.c diff3.c dir.c sdiff.c util.c
	in emacs:
			C-x v = (to show all changes)
			C-u C-c C-a (to undo a hunk)
			C-x C-c (to save)

11. Remove all untracked files that git status lists with the following command:
	$ git clean -f

12. Now generate a patch on the remaining modified files:
	$ git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt

13. Now build the resulting version of Diffutils using insns in (README-hacking)
	$ PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH  (so that ./bootstrap can find help2man)
	$ ./bootstrap
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make check
	
	running diff . - outputs error message without backticks:
	$ cd src
	$ ./diff . -

14. Now we perform a sanity check on our source code to generate diffs:
	$ ./diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch >quote-3.0-test.txt
	
15. Compare quote-3.0-test.txt and quote-3.0-patch.txt:
	$ diff quote-3.0-test.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt
	
	This showed that the files are not identical and that the differences
	did not cause any problems.
