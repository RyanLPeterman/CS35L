1. How can you get man to print all the commands that have a specific word in
 their man page (or at least the description part of the man page)? 

	man -k <specific word> -prints out all man pages that have the specific word
	in their short description or name

	man -k is the same as apropos which from its man page description searches 
	the whatis database for strings

2. Where are the cp and wc programs located in the file system?

	$ whereis cp
	cp: /bin/cp /usr/share/man/man1/cp.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1p/cp.1p.gz

	$ whereis wc 
	wc: /usr/bin/wc /usr/share/man/man1/wc.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1p/wc.1p.gz

3. What executable programs have names that are just one character long, and 
what do they do?
	
	to find all executables we can use find command containing the special 
	character ? (wild card) which represents any character:
	$ find / -executable -name ?
		outputs: many lines into std out (was told I didn't need to explain 
		what they did)

4. When you execute the command named by the symbolic link /usr/bin/cc, which
 file actually is executed?

	The file that is actually executed is /usr/bin/gcc
	This is evidenced by the following (inside /usr/bin):
	
	$ ls -l gcc    		   (shows us that cc is a softlink)
	$ readlink -f gcc      (output that the softlink points to /usr/bin/gcc)
	
	From the man page: readlink - print value of a symbolic link or 
	canonical file name

5. The chmod program changes permissions on a file. What does the symbolic
 mode g-s mean, in terms of permissions?

	$ chmod g-s file.txt
		- this is using the setgid functionality of chmod, which changes the 
		permission of the file such that it matches the permissions of the 
		group owner of the file

6. What option to find lets you search for files that have been modified in 
the last 3 days?

	find / -mtime -3
	this command prints out all the files in the file system that have been 
	modified in the past 3 days

7. Use the previous answer to find all directories modified in the last 3 days.

	$ find -mtime -3 -type d

8. Of the files in the same directory as find, how many of them are symbolic 
links?
	
	To find where find is: $ whereis find
	  this outputs -> /bin/find
	To find how many of them are symbolic links:
		The text for a symbolic link is blue so counting them gives me 18
	To do it more systematically:
		$ ls -la /bin/ | grep "\->" | wc -l
			1. lists information about all the files in /bin/
			2. sorts the lines by the -> (only soft links have)
			3. outputs the lines counted (outputs 18)

9. What is the oldest regular file in the /usr/lib directory?

	$ find /usr/lib -type f -printf '%T+ %p\n' | sort | head -n 1

	-type f specifies regular files
	-printf prints the format string after it
		%T+ prints the 24 hour time with the Data and time seperated by +
		%p prints files name
	We then pipe it to sort which sorts each line by their date
	Then we pipe it to head which outputs the first line of the piped data 
	using the -n 1 flag

	Output: 2003-08-29+12:56:11.0000000000 ./x86_64-redhat-linux5E/include/
	bits/stdio-lock.h

10. Where does the locale command get its data from?

	The locale command gets its data defined by the LC_* environment variables

11. In Emacs, what commands have sort in their name?

	To find which commands we can use the following command: C-h a sort in emacs
	This outputs the following commands:
	
		Buffer-menus-sort
		Buffer-menu-sort-by-column
		ibuffer-invert-sorting
		ibuffer-toggle-sorting-mode 
		rmail-sort-by-author
		rmail-sort-by-correspondent
		rmail-sort-by-date
		rmail-sort-by-lables
		rmail-sort-by-lines
		rmail-sort-by-recipient
		rmail-sort-by-subject
		sort-columns
		sort-fields
		sort-lines
		sort-numeric-fields
		sort-pages
		sort-paragraphs
		sort-regexp-fields
	
12. Briefly, what do the Emacs keystrokes C-a through C-z do? Can you list 
their actions concisely?

	C-a 	go to beginning of line
	C-b 	move one character backward
	C-c 	used with C-x C-c to exit Emacs permanently
	C-d		deleting a character forward
	C-e		go to end of line
	C-f		move one character forward
	C-g		abort partially typed or executing command
	C-h		start the help system
	C-i		used with C-h C-i to find specified function or variable in Info
	C-k		kill a line forward
	C-l		redraw garbaged screen
	C-m		insert new line and move to it
	C-n 	move forward over a line
	C-o		insert newline after point
	C-p		move backward over a line
	C-q		Used with C-x C-q for version control checkin/checkout
	C-r		search backward
	C-s		search forward
	C-t		transpose characters
	C-u		print the following character multiple times
	C-v		scroll to next screen
	C-w		kill region
	C-x		combines with other commands
	C-y		yank back last thing killed
	C-z		suspend Emacs 

13. In more detail, what does the Emacs keystroke C-g do?

	The C-g command aborts a partially typed or executing command. For example
	when a command is entered before the command can be processed or while it 
	is processed you can press C-g to in effect throw an execption to stop 
	emacs from doing what it was doing.

14 What does the Emacs yank function do?

	The yank function inserts text from the kill (cut) ring after the string 
	is processed by the yank-handler (paste) (similar to cut and paste).

15. When looking at the directory /usr/bin, what's the difference between the 
output of the ls -l command, and the directory listing of the Emacs 
dired command?

	The difference between the two is that you can see the parent directory
	in the Emacs dired command
	
	M-x dired enter /usr/bin in emacs vs in the shell
	/usr/bin -l
