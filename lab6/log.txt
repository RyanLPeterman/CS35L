Laboratory:

	First to make sure we have the right software:
		$ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

		shows that I don't have the openssh-server:
		$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server

	Server Side:

	1. Generate Public and Private Keys
		$ ssh-keygen

	2. Create an account for the client on the server:
		$ sudo useradd -d /home/elton -m elton
		$ sudo passwd elton
			- then set password for login

	3. Create .ssh directory for the new user
		$ cd /home/elton
		$ sudo mkdir .ssh

	4. Change Ownership for ssh dir:
		$ sudo chown -R elton .ssh
		$ sudo chmod 700.ssh

	Client Side:
	1. Generate Public and Private Keys
		$ ssh-keygen

		- it asked for a place (kept as default)
		- entered a passphrase

	2. Copy your public key to the server:
		$ ifconfig (to find ip address on partners computer)
		$ ping 10.97.85.103 (to check connectivity)
		$ ssh-copy-id -i elton@10.97.85.103 (elton 
		was the name of the account on the server)

	3. Add private key to authentication agent:
		$ ssh-add

	4. SSH to server:
		$ ssh -X elton@10.97.85.103

	5. Run firefox gui
		$ firefox
