1. execute locale to check if LC_CTYPE = "C" or "POSIX"
	if not then execute $ export LC_ALL='C'

2. next for the sorted list of English words we execute the following
	$ sort /usr/share/dict/words > words

3. To grab the HTML from the assignment's webpage use wget <URL>
	* the html is inside of assign2.html

4. See what the following commands output when the html file is fed in 
as std input

	tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < file.html
		- replaces all instances of characters that are not alphabetical 
		characters with new line characters
	tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
		- replaces all instances of charcters that are not alphabetical 
		characters with a single new line character (even if multiple not 
		alphabetical characters are present in a row)
	tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
		- sorts the previously mentioned list alphabetically 
	tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
		- only output the first of a sequence of lines that compare equal
	tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words
		- compares the sorted unique list of words with the file named words 
		in the current working directory
		- in three columns output, column 1 contains words unique to FILE 1 
		- column 2 contains words unique to FILE 2
		- column 3 contains words that appear in both files
	tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words
		- this outputs the same file as before except with columns 2 and 3 
		surpressed
		
5. Now we use the following shell script buildwords to generate 
a list of hawaiian words from the html

# contains the hfile passed in to standard input
html_file=$1

# Matches things only between td tags in html
grep "<td>.*</td>" $html_file | \
# use tr to remove horizontal whitespace
tr -d [:blank:]  | \
# Now remove tags
sed "s/<[^>]*>//g" | \
# use tr to remove additional whitespace
tr -s '\n' | \
# remove every other line for english words
awk '!(NR%2)' | \
# replace grave symbol with regular '
sed -r 's/`/'"'"'/g' | \
# change all uppercase to lower case
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | \
# treat all commas as newlines
tr , '\n' | \
# sort the list
sort -u | \
# remove every line character that isnt in the hawaiian language 
# (one word has a-) in it is it okay to delete this line?
sed '/[^p^k^m^n^w^l^h^a^e^i^o^u^'\'']/d'

Note: This words in my seasnet environment without accounting
for carriage returns from a windows environment

6. Now given the list of hawaiian words we can implement 
a hawaiian html page spell checker with the following command:

$ cat toCheck.txt | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' \
| sort -u | comm -23 - hwords | wc

This grabs all words from an html page and formats them for checking
against the list of hwords and counts the number of differing words
