Question 1.: Why did Brady's patch remove the line "case_long_iso_time_style:
"? Was it necessary to remove that line? Explain.
	
	Brady's patched removed the line with the case_long_iso_time_style: 
	because the goto statement in the for loop underneath was removed and 
	therefore the case in the switch statement is not necessary anymore.

Question 2: If your company adopts this patched version of Coreutils instead 
of the default one, what else should you watch out for? Might this new version
of Coreutils introduce other problems with your application, perhaps in 
countries where users don't speak English and don't understand English-format
dates?

	If the company adopts this patched version of Coreutils this could be a 
	problem if the company's software depends on the non UNIX 
	representation of the date. The UNIX representation may end up 
	causing bugs in other countries where the locale is different.

Q3. What happens when this script is invoked on an empty file like /dev/null, 
and why?

	In order to test the what would happen when running the script on an
	empty file I tried the following:
	$ touch empty
	$ python comm.py empty test1
	$ python comm.py test1 /dev/null

	Both tests output the contents of test1 as it should in the column
	that is unique to the test1 file

Q4. What happens when this script is invoked with Python 3 rather than 
Python 2, and why? (You can run Python 3 on the SEASnet hosts by using the 
command python3 instead of python.)

	To test the difference between the code I use the following commands:
	$ python comm.py -u test1 test2
	$ /usr/local/cs/bin/python3 comm.py -u test1 test2

	The output of the two programs differ in the ordering of the
	sets since it is likely that from python 2 to python 3 the way
	sets are created was changed and therefore how these unordered 
	sets are set is different.
