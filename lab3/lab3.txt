1. Download coreutils using the following command:
	$ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

2. Untar and unzip the downloaded tarball with the following:
	$ tar -xzvf

3. Now install broken ls in a folder coreutilsInstall:
	$ mkdir coreutilsInstall
	$ ./configure --prefix="absolute path"
	$ make
	$ make install

4. Now cd into coreutilsInstall and confirm the bug:
	$ cd coreutilsInstall/bin
	$ ./ls -l

	This confirms the bug since the dates come out in the following
	format: YYYY-MM-DD

5. Apply patch with the following command:
	$ cd coreutils-7.6/src  (this allows us to neglect -pnum flag)
		-pnum flag affects where the flag is applied relative to
		the directory specified in the patch by the creator
			i.e. it strips off slashs from the original dir

	$ patch -p < ../../patch    (patch was in my home dir)

6. Now recompile the code with make and test it on a recently
modified file with the following commands:
	$ make
	$ touch -d '10 Oct 2014' one_year_old
	$ touch newly_modified
	$ ./ls -l 

	This reveals that the dates are indeed UNIX format now
